> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would have do that for every project but since it github is a public hub so I will use it for my open source projects.

> why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

cause it give me more freedom to decide when I want to sync my branch with github branches which could be changed by other contributers.

> Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. when would you use one instead of another?

forks are copy's from and existing repository on github to your own gtihub account.
clones are copy's from repositories on your own device it can be copied from a public repository like github or your local computer.
branches are new sessoin of commits in a repository.
I use fork when I want to have copy of a repository and make my own changes on it, and use clone when I want to have a repository in my local machine and I use branches when I want do something on my local repository.

> what is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

you can track the changes on the remote since you made that copy, and with that you can see what kind of confilicts would happen if you want to push your changes up.
